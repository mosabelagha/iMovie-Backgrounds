# iMovie-Backgrounds
I was finally able to get the "Fairy Tale" iMovie credits background without all the annoying text and I felt like making it available to the world.
It's seriously unbelievable the amount of time I wasted to get this to work

For the record the fairy tale font is **Luminari Regular**
